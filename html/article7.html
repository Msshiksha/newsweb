                <h2>Many Deaths Due to Underestimating Corona: Jitendra Singh Shunty </h2>

                    During the severe COVID-19 pandemic, while most people avoided contact with even their loved ones, the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Sewa Dal took on the incredible responsibility of cremating unclaimed and other bodies with full rites. Jitendra Singh Shunty, the leader of this organization, shared their journey and motivations in an exclusive interview.
                </p>


            <p> <h3>Serving the Community for 25 Years     </h3><br>
                 
                For over 25 years, the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Sewa Dal has been serving the community. They have cremated more than 40,000 bodies and helped over 22,000 COVID-19 patients with their funeral vans and ambulances. During the pandemic, they managed to serve over 600 bodies and more than 1,200 COVID-19 patients. Remarkably, they conducted last rites for 150 bodies whose families were quarantined and 26 whose families had abandoned them.     </p>

                <p> 
                    <h3>A Heartbreaking Inspiration
                    </h3> <br>
                    Jitendra Singh Shunty was deeply moved by an incident at the Delhi Nigam Bodh Ghat. He saw a man who couldn’t afford to cremate his child, collecting burnt wood from other pyres. This heart-wrenching sight in a city like Delhi, where people spend millions on homes, weddings, and cars, motivated him to start offering free cremation services.

               </p>

               <p>
                <h3>Understanding the COVID-19 Situation in Delhi
                </h3> <br>
                Shunty explained that COVID-19 had reached its peak in India, with deaths increasing rapidly. The situation in Delhi was particularly alarming. Many people underestimated the severity of the virus, treating it like any other illness. Government statistics only reflected hospital deaths, but many more were dying at home. Crematoriums were running out of space, and there were long waits for CNG cremations. Over 1,000 people were dying every ten days. Hospitals were full, with no beds or ventilators available, and crematoriums were overwhelmed.     </p>

               <p>
               <h3>Dedicated Corona Warriors </h3><br>
               The Shaheed Bhagat Singh Sewa Dal is supported by many dedicated members. During the pandemic, 21 brave Corona Warriors joined Shunty in serving day and night. Sadly, one of these warriors lost their life to COVID-19. Despite the extreme heat and cold, these warriors worked tirelessly to help those in need.     </p>

      <p><h3>Personal Experience with Quarantine 
    </h3><br>
    Shunty and eight others from his team tested positive for COVID-19 and had to be quarantined. This experience opened his eyes to the struggles of quarantined individuals who had no one to turn to for help. Neighbors were afraid to approach them, leaving them isolated and helpless. Shunty’s organization decided to step in and ensure that quarantined people received the help they needed.
</p>

        <P> 
            Through their relentless service and dedication, the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Sewa Dal has set an inspiring example for the world, showing that compassion and community spirit can triumph even in the darkest times.
            </P>
