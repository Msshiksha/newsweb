                <p>
                New Delhi: Amidst the hustle and bustle of the Lok Sabha elections, the Supreme Court delivered a significant ruling regarding election
                candidates on Tuesday. The Court declared that candidates contesting elections are not required to disclose every movable asset owned by
                them or their dependents unless these assets are of substantial value or indicative of a luxurious lifestyle. The Supreme Court emphasized 
                that a voter does not have the absolute right to know about each and every asset of a candidate. The Court also clarified that this decision 
                should not be considered a precedent, as it is based on the specific facts and circumstances of this case.
            </p>

                <p>
                    With this observation, a bench comprising Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sanjay Kumar overturned the July 17, 2023, decision of the 
                    Itanagar Bench of the Gauhati High Court, thereby upholding the election of Karikho Kri. Kri was elected as an independent MLA from the 
                    Tezu Assembly seat in Arunachal Pradesh in 2019. The High Court had invalidated Kri's election, prompting him to approach the Supreme Court.  
                 </p>

                <p> 
                    The High Court had ruled on a petition filed by N. Tayang, Kri's rival and a former Congress candidate from the Tezu seat. The petition alleged 
                    that Kri failed to disclose in his nomination papers that he was residing in a government-provided MLA cottage, Cottage No. 1, in Sector-E, Itanagar. 
                    Additionally, Kri had not obtained a no-objection certificate from the relevant department concerning the rent, electricity charges, water charges, 
                    and telephone charges for the government accommodation. The petition also stated that Kri did not mention three vehicles owned by his wife and son 
                    in his nomination papers, leading to the High Court's decision to annul his election.

               </p>

               <p>
                The Supreme Court ruled that Kri had either gifted or sold these vehicles before filing his nomination, so they could not be considered as owned by his wife
                and son at that time. The Court dismissed the petitioner's argument that voters have a complete right to know everything about their candidates. The Supreme 
                Court stated that candidates are not required to declare every single movable asset, such as clothes, shoes, crockery, stationery, and furniture. However, if 
                an asset is valuable, it must be disclosed. For example, if a candidate or their family owns expensive watches worth lakhs of rupees, this information must be 
                provided as it reflects a high-value asset and a luxurious lifestyle.               
            </p>

               <p>
                This ruling provides clarity on the extent of disclosure required by election candidates, balancing the need for transparency with practical considerations.
