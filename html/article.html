                    In New Delhi, Jyoti Rachoya stands as a remarkable example of women empowerment. She may appear simple and homely, 
                    but as the councillor of Nangloi Ward 37, she has transformed the area. Ward 37 is one of the most crowded areas under 
                    the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, making public service here particularly challenging compared to other wards. 
                    However, Jyoti's management of the ward is truly commendable, earning satisfaction from the local residents.
                </p>

                <p>
                One of the primary responsibilities of the municipal corporation is sanitation. Since Jyoti took charge, sanitation issues
                in Nangloi Ward have significantly decreased. The ward has three garbage dumps, and despite the absence of decomposing machines, 
                the corporation has ensured that garbage remains contained within the dumps and doesn't spill onto the streets. This has provided 
                substantial relief to the residents who no longer suffer from garbage spread across the roads.
                </p>

                <p> 
               Councilor Jyoti Rachoya mentioned that she is always ready to address the problems of the local people. She has undertaken several
               community projects without relying on government funds, using her own money instead. Jyoti highlighted a major issue where garbage 
               from neighbouring wards, lacking their own dumps, often ends up in Nangloi Ward. The absence of a decomposer machine makes managing 
               this garbage challenging, sometimes resulting in garbage overflowing onto the streets. To address this, regular garbage collection 
               is arranged, and Jyoti personally oversees the cleanup when necessary.
               </p>

               <p>
               Furthermore, Jyoti has funded the renovation of a local community hall, ensuring it remains usable for local residents. She is also
               actively addressing issues related to sewer lines and dilapidated roads. Jyoti has consistently reported these problems to 
               Mundka's MLA, Dharmapal Lakra, but claims that he repeatedly ignores the complaints. According to Jyoti, the MLA not only fails to 
               provide support or assurances to the public but also remains inaccessible to them. Consequently, local residents turn to Jyoti for 
               solutions to their problems, which ideally should be addressed by the MLA.
               </p>

               <p>
               Jyoti Rachoya's dedication to her community and her hands-on approach in solving local issues have made a significant positive impact 
               on Nangloi Ward 37. Her efforts highlight the potential of women leaders in driving meaningful change at the grassroots level.
